__OpenCV computer vision with iOS: stitching panoramas__  

<img src = "https://github.com/foundry/OpenCVSwiftStitch/blob/meta/meta/example.big.jpg">

Version 3.0 of [OpenCVStitch](http://github.com/foundry/OpenCVStitch) - updated for Swift 3.0  
See appropriate branches for Swift 2.x

This project was created to a answer a couple of Stack Overflow questions:  
[libraries to CAPTURE panorama in iOS](http://stackoverflow.com/q/14062932/1375695)  
[Can I mix Swift with C++? Like the Objective - C .mm files](http://stackoverflow.com/q/24042774/1375695)    

v2 demonstrates how to mix Swift, Objective-C and C++ in one project whilst keeping the code clearly separate. 

The project AppDelegate and View Controller are written in Swift. Swift cannot talk directly to C++ (which we need for OpenCV), so we provide an Objective-C++ wrapper class to mediate between Swift and C++. We also provide an Objective-C++ category on UIImage to mediate between UIImage and CV::Mat image formats. The CVWrapper header file is pure Objective-C. For [v1](https://github.com/foundry/OpenCVStitch)(which doesn't use Swift) this separation was a matter of clean style. For v2, it is a requirement: if any C++ headers are included in the wrapper, the app will not compile (Swift won't like it).

__Installation__  
To run the project you need to install the OpenCV framework using Cocoapods    

Assuming you have first [installed CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html), run 'pod install' in this directory to install OpenCV for the project. From then on, always open the project in XCode from the `SwiftStitch.xcworkspace` file that the pod install creates. 

v3.1.0: The default podfile will install openCV v3.1.0, with a hotfix for arm64 compataibility

v2.4.9: Recomment the podfile:  
    pod 'OpenCV', '2.4.9-zp'  
    #pod 'OpenCV', '~> 3.1.0.1'  
Change the `#include` line for 2.4.9 compatibility as indicated in `stitching.cpp`  

__Use__  
OpenCVStitch is a very simple iOS/openCV example showing basic use of the Stitcher class. The c++ code is adapted from a sample included with the openCV distribution.  

The app has almost no user interface. On launch, the stitching code operates on four sample images, displaying the result in a UIScrollView.

__OpenCV Versions__  
_OpenCV 3.x_   
The podfile installs a hotfixed version of 3.1 as the prebuilt binary provided by openCV  [breaks on arm64 devices](https://github.com/kylefleming/opencv/releases/tag/3.1.0-ios-fix).

The stitching seems to be much more efficient (85% faster on my iphone 5s). However the quality is noticeably inferior with the test images supplied, so v2.4x remains the default for now [_some improvement with openCV 3.1_].

_OpenCV 2.4.x_  
The openCV distribution is not as clean as we would like.  
2.4.10 - the pod spec and the distribution build for iOS [is broken](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28331397/cocoapods-opencv-2-4-10-linker-error/28820510)  
2.4.9 - the pod spec [is broken](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31005022/cant-install-opencv-with-cocoapods-could-not-resolve-host-hivelocity-dl-sourc). This is likely a result of relying on Sourceforge for hosting.  

Therefore we are using a [self-hosted podspec](https://github.com/Zi0P4tch0/Specs/tree/master/Specs/OpenCV) (_thanks Matteo!_) until official channels are fixed. Specs are available for [2.4.9](https://github.com/Zi0P4tch0/Specs/tree/master/Specs/OpenCV/2.4.9-zp) and [2.4.10](https://github.com/Zi0P4tch0/Specs/tree/master/Specs/OpenCV/2.4.10-zp), but as the latter won't run we use 2.4.9.

_this version of OpenCVStitch opted to use cocoapods to overcome the [notorious](http://stackoverflow.com/q/13905471/1375695) [installation](http://stackoverflow.com/q/15855894/1375695) [issues](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14186883/1375695) with previous versions of the openCV 2.4.x framework.. it seems our optimism was slightly premature!_

__XCode 8__  

Project is now updated for Swift 3 and XCode 8. Point of no return! For backwards compatibility checkout the 2.0 / 2.1 branches or refer to the Objective-C version v1.0.
